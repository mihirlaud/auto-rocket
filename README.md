# auto-rocket :rocket:

A MATLAB control system for landing a simulated rocket. Created by [Mihir Laud](https://github.com/mihirlaud) for Purdue University ENGR 133 Fall 2020 final project. Licensed under [MIT License](https://mit-license.org/).

## Overview

```auto-rocket``` simulates a rudimentary rocket as a particle in three dimensions. The GUI allows users to create a rocket with an initial position and velocity and to simulate the rocket\'s powered descent. After the simulation is complete, the motion of the rocket will be plotted on a 3D graph alongside graphs of its altitude, vertical velocity, and vertical acceleration over time.

## Features

### Implemented :white_check_mark:
* User-defined initial position and velocity
* Kinematics-based control system in all dimensions

### To-Do :hourglass_flowing_sand:
* Gravity turn control system
* GFOLD
* Pinpoint landing
* Greater user control over variables (gravity, air resistance, etc.)
* Real-time motion vs time graphing
* Orientation graphs
